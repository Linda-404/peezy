# Peezy

This is an online Shoe Store for urban and sport sneakers.
I built this as my first semester project year 2 for my studies in front-end development.
Goal for this project was to create an e-commerce website that has both customer-facing and admin sections. Both sections should be responsive and the website will be populated by a Strapi API supplied by Noroff.

## Description

- User can view new shoes from slideshow
- User can view detailed information on a selected item
- User can add item to shopping cart
- Admin can add and delete item from site

## Built with

- Bootstrap
